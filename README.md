Scientific Calculator with graphs and tables

Only works on Windows 10

I have made a new update to it, I just haven't compiled it just yet, will compile soon.

Update logs (I haven't compiled it yet so the current version does not have these) - 

Conversion calculator (like ounces to grams, feet to meters, etc (only supports base measurements))

Clear command
